<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a> is simply the
  concept where your dependencies are handed to you (they are injected), instead of hard coding the
  implementation. This guide explains the built in support for the dependency injection on the iBus.
</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>There are several benefits of dependency injection, including better unit testing, and
  simplifying / reducing your code footprint. Since there are numerous resources available online
  explaining the benefits and drawbacks in detail, this guide will focus more on how to use
  dependency injection with the iBus.</p>
<h2>ObjectLoader</h2>
<p>Dependency injection on the iBus is provided by the ObjectLoader class. It is basically the "one
  stop shop" for everything related to dependency injection, and is responsible for the entire
  injection process. This includes looking up, constructing, and injecting all dependencies. It also
  provides the ability to define bindings (similar to a <a
      href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Bindings">guice module</a>), and also behaves like
  a general purpose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">factory
    pattern</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time you never use the ObjectLoader class directly since it works behind the scene
  for you. Instead, all you do is declare the resources you need (aka dependencies). The framework
  handles looking up implementations of those dependencies and handing them to you.</p>
<h1>Injecting objects</h1>
<p>Since dependency injection is just simply about being handed the resources you need, let's see
  what that looks like.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>To begin, let's take a simple code example that does not use dependency injection.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="dc8a17c2-0cdf-4a1c-ab8b-8b1e5688bb36" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body>public class Restaurant {

    private final Owner owner;
    private final Menu menu;

    public Restaurant() {
    this.owner = new OwnerImpl();
    this.menu = new MenuImpl();
    }
    }
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>As you can see, we set both variables in the constructor by using the <em>new</em> keyword. Now
  let's see how this is handled using dependency injection.</p>
<h2>Types of dependency injection</h2>
<p>There are three ways dependencies can be injected: constructor injection, field injection, and
  the @PostConstruct annotation. You may use any combination of these together, however it is
  important to know that injection always happens in this order: (constructor first, field next, and
  then @PostConstruct annotation).</p>
<h4>Constructor injection</h4>
<p>Constructor injection simply just means that resources are "injected" as parameters to the
  constructor.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="29abcad1-73b4-4198-98a0-e04c452d2a09" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    private final Owner owner;
    private final Menu menu;

    public Restaurant(final Owner owner, final Menu menu) {
    this.owner = owner;
    this.menu = menu;
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>And that's all there is to it. As you can see, it seems like a fairly small change, but this
  subtle change makes a big difference. If classes ask for their dependencies instead of
  constructing them, then frameworks can decide on the implementations, and we can even "inject"
  mock objects in order to write fully functional unit tests.</p>
<p>The ObjectLoader is what does the work to figure out the Owner and Menu implementation class,
  construct them, and call the Restaurant constructor with those objects.</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> Unlike some of the other dependency injection frameworks, the iBus dependency
  injection allows constructors to specify any number of parameters, throw any type of exception,
  and have any visibility (for example, public or private).</p>
<p>If you have multiple constructors, you can place @InjectValue on the constructor you want to use.
  However when there are multiple constructors and the @InjectValue is not used to specify a
  preference, public constructors are given preference over non-public ones. Additionally,
  constructors with the least number of parameters are currently given preference.</p>
<h4>Field injection</h4>
<p>Field injection is similar, but it just skips the constructor all together and sets the field
  values of your variables for you. The @InjectValue annotation indicates which fields need to be
  injected. Only fields that are annotated with the @InjectValue annotation (or another custom
  injection annotation) will be injected. Fields without these injection annotations are left
  alone.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="59b4aff3-7219-45e0-b5ad-0a480e90755b" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    @InjectValue
    private Owner owner;
    @InjectValue
    private Menu menu;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Again, pretty easy. All that we did was add an annotation to the variables that we wanted
  injected. The framework handles it from there.</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> The InjectValue annotation itself may not be needed if another injection-related
  annotation is used. The ObjectLoader allows any annotation that has been annotated with
  @InjectableAnnotation will count as a trigger for the injection process. All annotations described
  in this guide are injectable annotations.</p>
<h4>@PostConstruct annotation</h4>
<p>The @PostConstruct annotation is typically used for initialization. Any method annotated with
  @PostConstuct is invoked during the injection phase, almost like it is the constructor. However,
  since both constructor and field injection has already happened at this point, it has access to
  all variables set in this way.</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> Just like constructor injection, these methods may specify any number of parameters
  (all parameters are injected), throw any type of exception, and have any visibility (for example,
  public or private).</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="eb23f778-5fbd-4294-88f9-8654fb75aace" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    @InjectValue
    private Owner owner;
    @InjectValue
    private Menu menu;

    @PostConstruct
    void init(final MenuItemStorage storage) throws StorageException {
    final List
    <MenuItem> items = storage.loadItems(owner);
      menu.addItems(items);
      }
      }
      ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>In the example above, we are still using field injection, but we additionally add a
  @PostConstruct method where we populate menu items that have been stored.</p>
<h4>@PreDestroy annotation</h4>
<p>The @PreDestroy annotation is the opposite of the @PostConstruct annotation, and is called when
  objects are destroyed. For example, this may be a close or a shutdown method. Any method annotated
  with @PreDestroy is invoked when the object is released (see
  <ac:link ac:anchor="Lifecycle and Scoping">
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[#Lifecycle and Scoping]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  for more information.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> Just like the @PostConstruct annotation, a destroy method may specify any number of
  parameters (all parameters are injected), throw any type of exception, and have any visibility
  (for example, public or private).</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="329ae12d-19a8-4e3f-8564-22f70cb1b9a8" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    @PreDestroy
    void close(final MenuItemStorage storage) throws StorageException {
    storage.storeItems(menu.getItems());
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Here when we close we want to persist our menu items back into the store.</p>
<h2>Required versus optional dependencies</h2>
<p>By default, all dependencies are assumed to be required. This means that an object is not
  considered valid unless all dependencies have been injected with non-null values. For example, if
  we cannot find an implementation for one of the two dependencies in our Restaurant class, then
  that means we cannot construct a valid instance of a Restaurant.</p>
<p>There are times though when a resource is not required and we want to function properly without
  it. To specify this, set the "required" value on the InjectValue annotation to "false". The
  framework will still always attempt to look up an implementation, but if there are no
  implementation has been defined (called bindings), the value is not provided.</p>
<p>In both examples below, the menu is required, but the owner is optional. This means the menu will
  never be null, but the owner may or may not exist.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Parameter example</strong>
</p>
<p>To make parameters on constructors or methods not required, add the @InjectValue annotation in
  front of all non-required parameters (which is normally not needed with parameters) and set
  required to false. Any missing values are passed in as null. Again, remember that values by
  default are required (like menu), and will never be null. However here we are saying owner may be
  null.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="569c3ae6-31a8-4e47-bb63-c659cbbebb0e" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    private final Owner owner;
    private final Menu menu;

    public Restaurant(@InjectValue(required = false) final Owner owner, final Menu menu) {
    if(owner != null)
    this.owner = owner;
    else
    this.owner = Owner.DEFAULT_OWNER;
    this.menu = menu;
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Field example</strong>
</p>
<p>For field injection, the @InjectValue is already required, so you just need to set required to
  false. If an implementation is missing, the field is not modified (fields are NOT set to null,
  instead they are just ignored). This means that it will remain with whatever default value that
  has been set. If a field is null, it remains null. If it already has a default value, it is left
  as that.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="a573a602-f295-4158-b8a7-5b44f998b593" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    @InjectValue(required = false)
    private Owner owner = Owner.DEFAULT_OWNER;
    @InjectValue
    private Menu menu;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h2>Naming objects</h2>
<p>Objects can be given a name. For example, you could take a String object and say: this is not
  just any String, this is the "environment" string, and this string over here is the
  "connectionURL".</p>
<h4>Naming Primitive types</h4>
<p>When dealing with primitive classes (like String, Integer, etc.), as well as some other
  non-primitive, commonly used classes (like List, etc.), the class alone is not specific enough to
  know what needs to be injected. For example, a connection string and the environment string are
  both strings, so the String class alone is not enough to qualify the expected value. In this type
  of scenario, these types of values must be named.</p>
<p>Named values are used by filling out the value on the InjectValue annotation. For example:</p>
<p>
  <strong>Parameter example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="23c8805c-8e45-42d5-9aa9-a04c26343d0d" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    private final String environment;

    public Restaurant(@InjectValue("environment") final String environment){
    this.environment = environment;
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Field example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="b07815b6-ca74-4dbc-a01d-c1da851f8dbe" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    @InjectValue("environment")
    private String environment;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<hr/>
<p>In the examples above, there must be a string that has been bound which is named
  "environment".</p>
<h4>Qualifying an object</h4>
<p>In addition to when it is required, optionally naming an object also provides means the framework
  can uniquely identify a specific variable. The framework can then use the name of that variable to
  determine what to inject.</p>
<p>For example, we may have two different data access variables, and both are the same class,
  however we need two different implementations. In this scenario, we can name each object so the
  framework knows how to determine which implementation to use.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="a10b964b-847b-45bf-b13f-d3c59e09d776" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class MyService {

    @InjectValue("read")
    private MyDataAccess read;
    @InjectValue("write")
    private MyDataAccess write;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>In the example above, we can have a different class implementation for our read variable than we
  do our write. More on this is covered in the
  <ac:link ac:anchor="Bindings">
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[#Bindings]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  section.
</p>
<h4>Using named annotations</h4>
<p>When an object name is commonly used, annotations can be created to avoid copy/pasting the same
  string everywhere.</p>
<p>As an example, the @Environment annotation was created to represent @InjectValue("environment").
  The behavior of @Environment and @InjectValue("environment") are identical. These types of
  annotations are created for convenience only. For example:</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Parameter example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="d37b7640-b770-4393-8974-e24517db374f" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    private final String environment;

    public Restaurant(@Environment final String environment){
    this.environment = environment;
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Field example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="e0ae06bc-a93f-4d60-a40c-b04e83c51b89" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class MyService {

    @Read
    private MyDataAccess read;
    @Write
    private MyDataAccess write;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h4>Creating named annotations</h4>
<p>Creating these annotations is easy (but don't get carried away). The new annotation needs the
  @NamedAnnotation, and should look like this:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="5e5d2a88-c0a6-4a2d-839e-67901411d070" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@NamedAnnotation
    @Target({ ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD })
    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    public @interface Environment {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>By default, the name that the annotation represents is the simple class name with with the first
  character set to lowercase. For example, the default name for the custom annotation
  @BestObjectNameEver is "bestObjectNameEver", and would be identical to calling
  @InjectValue("bestObjectNameEver").</p>
<h1>Exception handling</h1>
<p>When being injected, objects are allowed to throw any exception in the constructor,
  @PostConstruct methods, and @PreDestory methods. However, due to the nature of dependency
  injection where resources are be injected, normally you will find there are no exceptions that you
  need to throw.</p>
<p>When an exception is thrown, the following happens:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If an object is constructed but an exception is thrown during either field injection or when
    invoking @PostConstruct phase, the object is released and any methods annotated with the
    @PreDestroy annotation are invoked. See
    <ac:link ac:anchor="Releasing and Lifecycle">
      <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[#Releasing and Lifecycle]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
    </ac:link>
    for more information.
  </li>
  <li>Additionally, any other constructed objects that were created during that phase are released.
    For example, if a service is created, and then a data access is created, but throws an exception
    during the @PostConstruct phase, the data access is released, and then the service is released
    as well, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The ObjectLoader itself throws two types of exceptions: MissingBindingException and
  FailedInstantiationException. Any other exception is wrapped.</p>
<h2>MissingBindingException</h2>
<p>A MissingBindingException means that a required object was requested, however no bindings
  (instructions) exist for the requested class. Basically it means the ObjectLoader was unable to
  find the implementation because there was nothing there to tell the ObjectLoader about an
  implementation class.</p>
<p>For services, in addition to default bindings for internal classes, the most common type of
  binding is a configuration bindings. For example, the service class itself comes from
  configuration. If you ever get a missing binding exception for the
  com.cerner.careaware.ibus.service.IBusService, that probably means the configuration was
  corrupted. Most of the time this means that someone manually imported or deleted the
  configuration. If this happens, re-run the deployer to correct this type of problem. More on this
  is covered in the
  <ac:link ac:anchor="Bindings">
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[#Bindings]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  section.
</p>
<p>
  <ac:inline-comment-marker ac:ref="1f939a96-ddb3-4d8a-8735-6db77dddafea">Another cause could be
    that an expected
  </ac:inline-comment-marker>

  <ac:inline-comment-marker ac:ref="1f939a96-ddb3-4d8a-8735-6db77dddafea"> is not present. For
    example, service proxies are loaded through a class called ServiceProxyLoader. If you get a
    MissingBindingException exception on a proxy, it might mean that your version of
    careaware-core-client is out of date.
  </ac:inline-comment-marker>
</p>
<h2>FailedInstantiationException</h2>
<p>The other type of exception is the FailedInstantiationException. This exception means we found
  the bindings (we knew what to construct), but there was some kind of a failure that happened as a
  result of constructing the object and injecting all of it's dependencies.</p>
<p>Exceptions thrown by constructors or the @PostConstruct methods are wrapped (kind of like a
  InvocationTargetException). For example, if we are have this code:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="f17d1222-7179-4f5e-b684-de35d1477c96" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Restaurant {

    @InjectValue
    private Menu menu;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>and the ObjectLoader finds an MenuImpl binding for the Menu interface, but the MenuImpl
  constructor throws an IllegalArgumentException, you would get a FailedInstantiationException that
  was caused by an IllegalArgumentException.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting stack traces</h2>
<p>When viewing exceptions in log related to dependency injection, it is important to look at the
  entire stack traces (especially the last exception). The exception at the bottom is normally the
  most important one, since it is the initial cause and the reason that injection failed. The other
  exceptions give you the full picture on how we got to that exception.</p>
<p>Looking at the following code example:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="311dd9e7-b7a1-4be4-9b19-c431530c1c91" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@DefaultBinding(ClassA.class)
    class ClassA {
    @InjectValue
    private ClassB b;
    }

    @DefaultBinding(ClassB.class)
    class ClassB {
    private final ClassC c;

    public ClassB(final ClassC c) {
    this.c = c;
    }
    }

    @DefaultBinding(ClassC.class)
    class ClassC {
    public ClassC() {
    throw new NullPointerException();
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Here we have ClassA that depends on ClassB, which depends on ClassC. But ClassC throws a
  NullPointerException in the constructor. And if we called code like this:</p>

<p>The stack trace tells us that at a high level, it failed to create an instance of ClassA, because
  it failed to create an instance of ClassB, because it failed to create an instance of ClassC. At
  the bottom, we see that the whole thing was caused by a NullPointerException thrown in the ClassC
  constructor.</p>
<p>The first and last exceptions are typically the most important, but due to the dynamic nature of
  dependency injection, the stack trace fills in all of the gaps in the middle to help with
  troubleshooting.</p>
<h1>Looking up objects directly</h1>
<p>The ObjectLoader class also allows you to ask for objects yourself (similar to something like a
  factory or provider pattern). One thing that is nice is that retrieving dependencies directly this
  way is identical to how dependencies are injected by the framework, so you benefit from all of the
  same functionality.</p>
<h2>Get methods vs. lookup methods</h2>
<p>There are two types of methods used to retrieve objects. There are "lookup" methods, and there
  are "get" methods. The only difference between these methods are that the "lookup" method may
  return null if no binding is found that object, while the "get" method will never return null, but
  instead will throw a MissingBindingException. (Quite literally, the "get" method just calls the
  "lookup" method, and throws an exception if the value is null). Use the "get" method when the
  object is required, or use "lookup" if it is optional.</p>
<h2>Get / lookup</h2>
<p>The basic get method takes class or interface and returns you an instance of the object.</p>

<p>Looking up / getting instances using the ObjectLoader will have the same result as injecting
  them. Normally it is better to just inject resources, however there are times when you may need
  this.</p>
<p>On a side note, you can also use the ObjectLoader#get method like a <a
    href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/InjectingProviders">Guice provider</a>.</p>
<h2>Get / lookup (qualified)</h2>
<p>In addition to the basic get/look methods, there is another pair that takes an ObjectBinding
  object.</p>

<h2>Getting primitive types by name</h2>
<p>Unlike our MyDataAcces example, when dealing with immutable primitive values (like String or
  Integer), since there's no real way to fail instantiating the object, all that really matters is
  that a value was provided and bound to the given name.</p>
<p>As a convenience, a getByName method is provided for these types of values (where they are not
  constructed, but they must have already been bound by name).</p>

<h1>Bindings</h1>
<p>When a object injected or
  <ac:link ac:anchor="Looking up objects directly">
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[directly looked up]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  , the ObjectLoader needs to know how to get that object. Should the ObjectLoader create a new
  instance using some implementation class? Is there already an instance out there to use? Bindings
  are the instructions that tell the ObjectLoader what implementation to use.
</p>
<p>For example, when the Restaurant class needs a Menu injected, with Java it is practically
  impossible to know about implementation classes. And even if we could, we don't know for sure what
  implementation to use in which scenario. This is where bindings come in. We need a binding to tell
  the ObjectLoader to use construct a new instance using the MenuImpl class.</p>
<p>Bindings are always required, however thankfully there are also lots of different types of
  bindings available, and they are easy to use. We'll cover the main types in the next few
  sections.</p>
<h2>Configuration bindings</h2>
<p>Bindings often come from
  <ac:link>
    <ri:page ri:content-title="iBus Configuration Developer Guide"/>
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[configuration (ContextData)]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  . This means that the schema for a service or an application can define the exact implementation
  class to use at runtime.
</p>
<p>We'll see two ways to use configuration bindings, but first lets cover a some of the benefits of
  using configuration based bindings:</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bindings are externalized</strong>
</p>
<p>Configuration bindings allow you to define bindings in your configuration schema. Because the
  schema is created as part of the packaging/assembly process, it means that bindings do not need to
  be hard-coded in your service or application, which means changing implementations can easily be
  done without code changes in your service or application.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Schema condition language</strong>
</p>
<p>Because bindings are defined in a schema, it means you can use the schema condition logic to
  define your implementation. You can flex which implementation to use based on the configuration
  the user enters (or even disable a injected resource all together). For example, you could define
  a drop down or any other control to control which implementation to use. Or you can choose to. You
  can even analyse the syntax of a connection URL to identify the proper implementation to load.</p>
<h4>Binding class implementations</h4>
<p>Configuration binding work by binding the name of the interface class (aka the key) to the name
  of the implementation class (aka the value). In the most basic form, it looks like this:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="6490b6ff-6337-4ae5-a796-c44e975495f2" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[final SchemaElement element = ELEMENT_STRING(null, null, new
    ContextKey
    <String>(MyInterface.class.getName()));
      element.addConditions(IF(ALWAYS()).init(MyImplementation.class.getName()).readOnly().hide());
      ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>This is basically a hidden constant in the schema language. The value is always set to the name
  of the implementation class and is always hidden. Like with other common scenarios, there is an
  ELEMENT_BINDING method provided in the SchemaHelper class.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="75d9b1c5-afd4-4f0d-8792-3e79d3a8fc53" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[final SchemaElement element = ELEMENT_BINDING(MyInterface.class,
    MyImplementation.class);
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>You can also make your implementation flex based on configuration. For example:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="b18f2b67-398f-49f3-a86f-9368054858d0" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[// This is a drop down with two modes
    final SchemaElement mode = ELEMENT_STRING("Mode", "Determines the mode", MODE_KEY);
    mode.addConditions(IF(ALWAYS()).enforce("DefaultMode", "AlternateMode"));

    // The ELEMENT_BINDING method already adds
    IF(ALWAYS()).init(MyDefaultImpl.class.getName()).readOnly().hide()
    final SchemaElement element = ELEMENT_BINDING(MyInterface.class, MyDefaultImpl.class);

    // We need to insert above the IF(ALWAYS()) condition that says if mode == "AlternateMode", then
    set the value to our MyAlternateImpl class
    element.insertConditions(0, IF(RULE_JOIN(mode,
    RULE_EQUALS("AlternateMode"))).init(MyAlternateImpl.class.getName()).readOnly().hide());
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h4>Binding class implementations by name</h4>
<p>In the
  <ac:link ac:anchor="Naming objects">
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[#Naming objects]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  section, we learned that objects could be named, and that we could use that name to also indicate
  specific bindings. This applies to configuration bindings as well.
</p>
<p>The difference with named configuration bindings is that instead of just using the name of the
  class as the key, we add a ".name" to the end. For example:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="fd26d01b-5cdc-4118-bf7d-cbd68e24ed1a" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[final SchemaElement element = ELEMENT_STRING(null, null, null, new
    ContextKey
    <String>(klass.getName() + ".myName"));
      element.addConditions(IF(ALWAYS()).init(implementationClass.getName()).readOnly().hide());
      ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>And just like before, there is a helper method for this:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="de1c5054-9318-4e0b-997c-c0a645e504dd" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[final SchemaElement element =
    ELEMENT_NAMED_BINDING(MyInterface.class, "myName", MyImplementation.class);
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>You can also use conditions on named configuration binding elements just like we did without a
  name.</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> If an object has a named there must be an explicit binding for that name. It will
  NOT default to using the the binding without a name. For example:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="1c315fd0-573c-43ad-b3e8-0d09ea351334" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[// Every MyInterface object named "read" will use MyReadImpl
    final SchemaElement readImpl = ELEMENT_NAMED_BINDING(MyInterface.class, "read",
    MyReadImpl.class);

    // Every MyInterface object named "write" will use MyWriteImpl
    final SchemaElement writeImpl = ELEMENT_NAMED_BINDING(MyInterface.class, "write",
    MyWriteImpl.class);

    // Every MyInterface without a name will use this.
    final SchemaElement defaultImpl = ELEMENT_BINDING(MyInterface.class, MyDefaultImpl.class);
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h2>@DefaultBinding annotation</h2>
<p>The DefaultBinding annotation is a type of binding that can be used to specify the default
  implementation class. This is one of the lowest priority bindings, which means it is only used if
  no other bindings exist.</p>
<p>When you use this annotation on a class or interface, you are specifying that any time you see
  that class, you should use that implementation by default. For example:</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Implementation class example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="6d489679-85f2-47fd-bebe-26abb4815d3c" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@DefaultBinding(MyImplementation.class)
    public interface MyInterface {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>The example above means that anywhere you want MyInterface, you will get an instance of
  MyImplementation if no other bindings exist.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You can also bind a class to itself, like this:</p>
<p>
  <strong>Same class example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="6bf6a52d-04a1-405b-9a5e-26a149f20073" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@DefaultBinding(MyClass.class)
    public class MyClass {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Even when you have a concrete class that you want to instantiate, you still need to explicitly
  let the ObjectLoader know that it should create an instance of MyClass when it is requested.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You may also use this on fields or parameters to dictate a default implementation if one is not
  provided.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Field example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="099f5320-02b6-467d-882e-106aa1e2e3ca" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@DefaultBinding(MyImplementation.class)
    private MyInterface mine;
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>
  <strong>Parameter example</strong>
</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="2f3f7843-355e-4867-bc3a-e0636bda6d6a" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[private MyClass(@DefaultBinding(MyImplementation.class) final
    MyInterface mine) {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<hr/>
<p>When both class level default bindings and field or parameter level default bindings are used,
  field and parameter default bindings take priority. Also, when using this on a class or interface,
  the binding only applies to the class or interface that is annotated. If you had MyInterface2 that
  extended MyInterface, the annotation for MyInterface does not apply when a request comes in for
  MyInterface2. If the same default implementation can be used for both MyInterface and
  MyInterface2, then both interfaces would need the default binding annotation.</p>
<h2>Bind annotations</h2>
<p>There are times we need to set a value in code for a particular variable.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we have we have a @Color annotation, which signifies the name of a color
  (eg: "blue", "red", etc.).</p>
<p>When you need the color, you ask for it like this (just like @Environment, etc.):</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="c9ef705c-0f3b-4f0c-a821-5aeafce54914" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@Color
    private String color;
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Imagine then that we have a Paint class that has a color. It would look like this:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="06773ccf-7ff0-4c9b-a3d6-8a764f474f16" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class Paint {
    private final String color;

    public Paint(@Color final String color) {
    this.color = color;
    }
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>In our code though, in order to inject a Paint object, we need to specify the color of the paint.
  Instead of binding "color" by name using the ObjectLoader.bindToAnnotation method, we can actually
  use a special @Color.Bind annotation in order to set the color value for the paint. It looks like
  this.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="5e69fe8f-60bc-4455-9b45-d8a5102945f3" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class MyClass {

    @Color.Bind("blue")
    private Paint paint;
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Setting this means that when Paint (and any of it's dependencies) need the color, it will be
  "blue". This means that Paint, and all of its dependencies will be able to inject @Color, and they
  will get "blue" as the value.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One thing to point out is that using this type of annotation only effects the object it is on
  (and all of its dependencies). For example, if MyClass had other variables that were injected,
  they do not have access to the @Color "blue" unless they also have that same binding.</p>
<p>In a scenario were we want multiple injected values to be able to see the binding, we can set it
  at the class level. This means that the service, and everything under the service (including its
  dependencies, and dependencies of its dependencies, etc.) For example:</p>

    @InjectValue
    private Moon moon; // Here we have a blue moon

    @Color
    private String color; // We can even get the color ourselves
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h2>CustomLoaders</h2>
<p>When the existing binding logic and / or construction logic is not enough, you are able to write
  your own custom loader by extending the class CustomLoader. For example, CustomLoaders are used by
  frameworks to allow legacy code lines to be injected properly. Try to only use CustomLoaders if
  you have to. Ideally you should use bindings like the
  <ac:link ac:anchor="Configuration bindings">
    <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[#Configuration bindings]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>
  </ac:link>
  .
</p>
<p>The following is an example of a CustomLoader</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="e03733bd-0189-4ea1-a1ff-683c33f5847f" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class MyThirdPartyCustomLoader extends CustomLoader {
    @Override
    protected
    <C> C lookup(final Class
      <C> klass, final ObjectLoader loader, final LoaderContext context) throws Exception {
        if (klass != ThirdPartyAPI.class)
        return null;
        final ThirdPartyAnnotation annotation =
        context.getAnnotatedElement().getAnnotation(ThirdPartyAnnotation.class);
        if (annotation == null)
        return null;
        final Class<? extends ThirdPartyAPI> implClass = getThirdPartyImpl(annotation.value());
        return loader.newInstance(implClass);
        }
        }
        ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Since your CustomLoader may be called to analyse every single injected object, it is important to
  return null as soon as possible if the class requested is not related to your CustomLoader.</p>
<p>The LoaderContext provides access to information about the request. For example, you have access
  to any annotations, the name of the object, the scope for the object, if there is a default
  binding, etc. It also provides information on where the class is being injected, as well as any
  parent LoaderContext information.</p>
<p>There are two ways to register CustomLoaders.</p>
<h4>Local registration</h4>
<p>Custom loaders can be registered directly on an ObjectLoader to provide special logic that is
  specific to that instance of the loader.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="3583e7b7-5a20-4b53-afac-5f7ed9613948" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[loader.register(new CustomLoader() {
    @Override
    protected
    <C> C lookup(final Class
      <C> klass, final ObjectLoader loader, final LoaderContext context) throws Exception {
        // Lookup logic
        }
        });
        ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>If you register a CustomLoader instance directly on an ObjectLoader, only that ObjectLoader will
  use that CustomLoader (which includes any child loaders created off of that ObjectLoader).</p>
<h4>Global registration</h4>
<p>CustomLoaders are normally registered at a global, system level. This means every ObjectLoader
  has access to these CustomLoaders.</p>
<p>These system custom loaders are discovered using SPI. To expose your new loader, under the
  "src/main/resources" folder in your project, you will want to create a new folder structure / file
  (in src/main/resources) called:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="0c6c7b1e-9dc2-4347-8fe6-84bb95055d9c" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[META-INF/services/com.cerner.careaware.ibus.core.bind.CustomLoader
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>The content of the file is the full class name of your implementation, for example:
  "com.cerner.careaware.mysolution.MyCustomLoader".</p>
<h2>Manual Binding</h2>
<p>The ObjectLoader class allows you set bindings in code. These methods can be used when needed,
  but can also be helpful when tests require the use of the ObjectLoader for binding mock
  implementations.</p>
<h4>Bind an implementation classes</h4>
<p>Similar to the DefaultBinding, you can bind specific the class to use by calling the bind(Class,
  Class) method. When you do this, any time the ObjectLoader comes across a request for that class,
  it will use the implementation you provided.</p>
<p>For example, you can bind an interface to an implementation.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="8271295a-2bb6-4aed-8975-115e40827e67" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[loader.bind(MyInterface.class, MyImplementation.class)
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Or you can bind a class to itself so it can be instantiated.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="c2608862-8d48-4c0d-a870-b8771a5c1ceb" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[loader.bind(MyClass.class, MyClass.class)
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h4>Bind an instance</h4>
<p>If needed, you can actually bind a constructed object using the bind(Class, Object) method.</p>
<p>For example, you can bind an already constructed object:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="f37fc9dc-7601-4b1d-8d67-f1ae28cd1cac" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[MyClass instance = ...
    loader.bind(MyClass.class, instance);
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h4>Bind to name</h4>
<p>For primitive types (like String or Boolean) or named objects, you can bind the instance by name
  instead of class.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="5f4bb3b6-bdb0-4f74-ab81-4bfc65a1c190" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[loader.bindToName("environment", "DEV");
    loader.bindToName("color", "blue");
    loader.bindToName("maxSize", 100);
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>And since annotations can be used in place of names, there is a bindToAnnotation method
  available.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="636a1c24-32f7-4e78-84be-bfe5678da65c" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[loader.bindToAnnotation(Environment.class, "DEV");
    loader.bindToAnnotation(Color.class, "blue");
    loader.bindToAnnotation(MaxSize.class, 100);
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h2>Binding order</h2>
<p>The list below specifies the order in which bindings are prioritized. The ObjectLoader will use
  the first available binding.</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> The ObjectLoader supports using a system property (where the key is the name of the
  requested class, and the value is the name of the implementation class), which takes precedence
  over any other type of binding. However this is only intended to be used as a stop-gap for
  emergency scenarios, and should not be used as a part of the design.</p>
<p>When a class is requested, the ObjectLoader first looks up objects bound locally:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Instance Bindings</strong> - Looks for instances explicitly bound in code using the
    bind(Class, Object), bindToName, and bindToAnnotation methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implementation Class Bindings</strong> - Looks for implementation classes explicitly
    bound in code using the bind(Class, Class) method.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Locally registered CustomLoaders</strong> - Looks for instances from any custom loaders
    registered in code using the register(CustomLoader) method.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If no binding is found, then this process is repeated for each parent loader. And then that
  parent will then check it's parent, etc.</p>
<p>If no parent has a local binding for the requested class, it will check global bindings. This is
  where the majority of the bindings come from in a production environment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>System registered CustomLoaders</strong> - Looks for instances from any custom loaders
    which are found on the system. Configuration based bindings are performed by a system registered
    CustomLoader.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SPI Bindings</strong> - Although not often used, the ObjectLoader supports looking up
    implementations using SPI property files.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If still no binding is found, then it will use the default binding.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Default Bindings</strong> - Looks up the default implementation using the DefaultBinding
    annotation (for example the @DefaultBinding).
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>ObjectLoader Hierarchy</h1>
<p>ObjectLoaders themselves have a hierarchy, in that they have parents and children. The main
  benefit of this hierarchy is inheriting bindings from your parent.</p>
<p>Creating new loaders is done by calling the newLoader() method. The ObjectLoader.DEFAULT is at
  the root level. Any bindings at this level are available for all other loaders. However, children
  always overwrite the behavior of their parents. So as we saw in the previous section, the
  ObjectLoader first looks for bindings on itself, before moving to its parent.</p>
<h2>Hierarchy example</h2>
<p>So then we have the question: when should I use the newLoader method?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, you can use the method any time you have conflicting bindings. For example,
  let's look at a made up service that has some plugable modules, however each module has a
  different bindings.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="53243f3d-d821-4b32-a1cf-9d3b18f33fcb" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[public class MyService {
    @InjectValue
    private ObjectLoader loader; // This represents the loader for this service instance

    private final List
    <PluggableModule> modules = new ArrayList
      <PluggableModule>();
        private List
        <ModuleConfiguration> moduleConfigurations = ... // However you get this information.

          @PostConstruct
          void init() {
          for (final ModuleConfiguration config : moduleConfigurations) {
          final ObjectLoader moduleLoader = loader.newLoader(); // Create a new child loader for
          each module we create.

          // Then we bind each configuration for each module.
          moduleLoader.bind(PluggableModule.class, config.getImplClass()); // Here we can bind the
          implementation class
          moduleLoader.bindToName("moduleName", config.getName()); // And bind the name
          moduleLoader.bind(ModuleConfiguration.class, moduleConfig); // Maybe we need to bind the
          entire ModuleConfiguration object itself
          final PluggableModule module = moduleLoader.get(PluggableModule.class); // Once we get the
          module, it has the configuration we bound.
          modules.add(module);
          }
          }
          }
          ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>As you can see, each module will have different bindings (like a different name and
  implementation class).</p>
<h1>Shared Objects</h1>
<p>Many times you may want to share the same instance of an object between classes. But in order to
  do that, we need to decide who all gets the same instance of an object.</p>
<h2>Using the @SingletonBinding annotation</h2>
<p>This annotation can be placed on an class to signify that it is a static singleton. This means
  that only one instance may exist in the entire JVM. Any time an instance of that object is
  requested, the same object is returned.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="2fba2df7-9bd1-49cf-bb65-fba7cf7e60ca" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@SingletonBinding
    public class MySingletonClass {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>In this example, this means that once an instance of MySingletonClass is constructed, the same
  instance will always be returned for every request.</p>
<p>One small thing just to know is that unlike the SharedInstance annotation, this annotation
  automatically counts as an default binding to itself. For example:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="60a0292a-c0fa-4341-b1c3-b93863e176ea" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@SingletonBinding
    public class MyClass {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>also implies this:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="eb0c1a1e-be7f-4f5c-a8eb-d49e01d986ac" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@DefaultBinding(MyClass.class)
    public class MyClass {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h2>Using the @SharedInstance annotation</h2>
<p>This annotation is used to support sharing object instances across a specific scope. This is
  similar to the @SingletonBinding, except that the object is not scoped statically. Instead, it is
  scoped to an object. When you declare the annotation, you specify the name of that scope
  object.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="558d58ba-d26d-4c06-8f59-38ff4e42d6c5" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">
  <ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[@SharedInstance(SharedInstance.ENVIRONMENT)
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>is tied to the iBus environment. If the environment is "PROD", it also means the lifecycle of the
  objects are tied to "PROD". There will only be one instance of a resource for "PROD". Everyone
  needing that resource that have the environment "PROD" will all share the same instance of that
  object.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>If you specify the annotation on a class, you are saying that all instances of the annotated
  class will be shared, one for each scope object.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="a86a5c7b-1800-44bf-b2df-3c98dbcbc10c" ac:name="code"
                     ac:schema-version="1">

    public class MyClass {
    }
    ]]>
  </ac:plain-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>Putting it on a variable also works. If the class doesn't already specify it, you can specify
  what instances of the object you want to share.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id="cce4d404-5f75-4e72-856b-e00b2efd5541" ac:name="code"

<h4>Common scope object names</h4>
<p>A list of common scopes and when and how to use them is included. Note that most objects should
  be tied to the life cycles of a service or container.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Shared Per Service</strong>
</p>
<p>If this annotation is used, there will be only one instance of a resource per service. Objects
  scoped to a service have their lifecycle managed in tandem with that service. If the service is
  stopped, those objects are released. If the service is started, new objects are created. Most
  objects should be shared per service.</p>

<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Shared Per Container</strong>
</p>
<p>If this annotation is used, there will be only one instance of a resource per iBus container (and
  therefore, one per tenant). Objects scoped to a container scope have their lifecycle managed in
  tandem with that container. If the container is shut down, those objects are released. If the
  container is started, new objects are created. The container scope should only be used in the
  context of the <a

    Framework</a>

<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Shared Per Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>If this annotation is used, there will be only one instance of a resource per environment. An
  environment scope should be used to tie an object to a particular iBus connection. For an example,
  the actual IBusConnection object itself is bound to this scope. Other classes like service proxies
  and other connection based client APIs also will be shared per environment.</p>

<h4>Scope Upgrading</h4>
<p>To ensure that objects managed by the service framework have their lifecycles handled properly,
  the object loader framework may need to perform scope upgrades. These happen due to the fact that
  a service container can be running while its service(s) are stopped, but a service cannot be
  running while its service container is stopped. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Container Scope Upgrading</strong>
</p>
<p>Objects tied to the container life cycle cannot rely on dependencies tied to a service lifecycle,
  as a service may be brought down while its container is still up. In cases where a container
  scoped object is responsible for initializing a service scoped object, the object will instead be
  initialized with a container scope and therefore tied to the container lifecycle.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Environment Upgrading</strong>
</p>
<p>Objects tied to the container life cycle cannot rely on connections shared with objects tied to
  the service lifecycle. If an object tied to the container scope is instantiated by a service
  scoped object, or due to an object instantiated in the process of creating that service scoped
  object, environment data (if present) will be upgraded to use the container information as
  metadata instead of the service information. Therefore any connections instantiated by the
  container will use this new environment data to connect.</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-size: 30.0px;letter-spacing: -0.008em;">Releasing and Lifecycle</span>
</p>
<p>Once objects are no longer needed, they need to be released (aka destroyed). When an object is
  released, any @PreDestroy methods are invoked. Additionally, any @SharedInstance references to
  that object are cleared, and any LifecycleHooks are notified that the object has been released.
  Releasing objects is done by calling the release() method on the ObjectLoader, and passing in all
  objects to be released.</p>
<p>While all objects should be released, frameworks that control the lifecycle of your object will
  automatically release your injected dependencies for you (for example, the iBus service framework
  automatically releases all injected resources for a service when it is destroyed). However, if
  required resources have a shorter lifespan that your object, you need to release those resources
  manually. This is typically done through the use of LifecycleHooks. The ObjectLoader framework
  does not control the lifecycle of objects directly. Instead, it delegates that information to the
  frameworks and consuming code.</p>
<h4>LifecycleHooks</h4>
<p>The LifecycleHook interface is used for notifying when objects are created and when they are
  released. This can be used in a variety of ways, however the most common use for a LifecycleHook
  is for releasing objects once they are no longer needed. The BasicLifecycleHook class is a basic
  implementation that provides the ability to keep track of which objects have been created for an
  entire scope. Once we are done with that scope, all instantiated objects can then be released.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <strong>Worker example</strong>
</p>
<p>As an example, let's say we have a service that needs to schedule work to be done every so often.
  We know we need resources every time we run (maybe like a database connection), but we don't
  really want to keep those resources around for the entire lifecycle of our service (and besides,
  maybe we need to be able to run multiple at a time and not all resources may be thread safe).
  Instead of having everything injected upfront, we'll just get our resources when we run. Once we
  are finished though, we need to clean up after ourselves and release all acquired resources.</p>
<p>We use a BasicLifecycleHook to keep track of the resources for us (remember, the MyWorker
  implementation may have additional injected resources that we do not know about or care to
  track).</p>

<h1>@DataGroup and @DataName annotations</h1>
<p>The @DataGroup and @DataName annotations are used together define how resources are shared and
  qualified.</p>
<p>For example, a TaskBoard with a data group of "MyService", and a data name of "purge" will share
  the same data as another TaskBoard with the same data group and data name (assuming they are the
  same implementation of course, since JDBCTaskBoard can never share the same data as
  JDBCObjectStore). Also, it is find to use the same data group anddata name across different types
  of frameworks (for example, it's not a problem for a TaskBoard and an ObjectStore to have the same
  DataGroup and DataName).</p>
<p>The importance of @DataGroup and @DataName are to help qualify a resource. The data group
  differentiates the "purge" TaskBoard of the "LocationService" from the "purge" TaskBoard of the
  "PatientService". Without the @DataGroup, the @DataNames would conflict other services, and the
  two services separate types of services would share the same TaskBoard data.</p>
<p>For services, the @DataGroup should typically always be the service type (eg: "LocationService").
  You should use the same data group for any framework that need the @DataGroup annotation (eg:
  TaskBoard, ObjectStore, ActivationManager, and MessageSubscriptionManager etc.) This allows these
  frameworks to know they are related, and they can more efficiently define where the data should be
  stored.</p>
<p>It is important to try to keep both the @DataGroup and @DataName as short and simple as possible.
  For example, if you have a ObjectStore for encounters, there is no need to set the data name to
  "EncounterObjectStore" or anything like that. Instead, just call it "encounter". The ObjectStore
  already knows it is an ObjectStore, but you are saying it is an ObjectStore for encounter
  data.</p>
<p>By convention, typically the data group follows class naming conventions (eg: "MyGroup"), while
  the data name follows variable naming conventions (eg: "myName").</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Can I use the standard Java annotations (Like @Inject and @Named)?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Not yet. Since Java 7 is not a minimum iBus version, these standard annotations are not used.
    Even though these are available through the use of an external jar, we've learned from the past
    that including external jars with classes has consequences. Instead, the use of the annotation
    @InjectValue provides similar support for @Inject and the @Named annotations. Once java 7 is
    supported, support for the standard annotations may likely be added.

    <strong>Which dependency injection method should I use?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>There is plenty of debate around this, and as clean as I think field inject looks, constructor
    injection tends to be the most preferred overall. There is plenty of discussion online if you
    are interested.
